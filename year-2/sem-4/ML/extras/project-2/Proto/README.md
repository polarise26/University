For this project, I have web-scraped for stats from [basketball-reference.com](https://basketball-reference.com), and stored it in csv files so that it would be easy to perform operations and store in dataframes etc.  

After scraping the stats, I have done some cleaning and merging so that the data can be used meaningfully, to perform exploratory data analysis(EDA). FOr EDA, I will be looking at representing the stats of MVPs from different NBA seasons, players, and teams.
